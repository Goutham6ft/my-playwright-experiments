# 🎭 my-playwright-experiments

Welcome to my personal playground for exploring [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) — a powerful end-to-end testing framework for modern web apps!

This repository documents my journey as I learn and experiment with Playwright using **TypeScript**, covering everything from the basics to more advanced patterns. Whether it’s custom fixtures, test automation practices, or quirky DOM interactions — it’s all here!

## 🔍 What's inside?
- 💡 Custom fixtures and setup techniques
- 🧪 Real-world test cases using Playwright APIs
- 🛠️ TypeScript-based test structures
- 🎯 Experiments with selectors, locators, and browser contexts
- 📝 Notes and code snippets from my learning journey

## 🚀 Why this repo?

I created this space to:
- Practice hands-on testing concepts
- Build a reusable library of Playwright examples
- Track my growth and reference things easily
- Have fun breaking (and fixing) things in the browser 😉

## 📌 Note

This is a **learning-first** repository — some scripts might be experimental, incomplete, or purely for exploration.
