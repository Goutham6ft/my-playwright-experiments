## My Execution Flow

1. First Create a test using playwright cogen.
2. Create functions.
3. Create fixtures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Playwright Functions

- Use **functions** to wrap common **locators and actions** ‚Äî it improves **reusability** and **readability**
- Helps separate test logic from UI behavior
- Keeps test files clean and focused on flow, not low-level DOM operations

## üß© Playwright Custom Fixtures

- Fixtures can be used for:
  - **Function invocation**
  - **Configuration setup**
  - Common setup/teardown logic (like launching pages, cleaning sessions)
  - **Listening for JavaScript exceptions during test execution**
- Fixtures are executed per test unless scoped differently (like `worker` scope)
- They help reduce duplicate `page.goto()` or setup boilerplate in every test file
